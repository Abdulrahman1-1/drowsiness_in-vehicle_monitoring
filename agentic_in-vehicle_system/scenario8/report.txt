Report:{
Hey there! I noticed that you're going at a speed of 70 kph, which is safe since the limit is 100 kph. However, there's something important we need to address. It seems like you're experiencing microsleep, which can be quite dangerous, especially when driving. I want to make sure you stay safe on the road! 

Also, I see that you're not wearing your seatbelt. Seatbelts are super important for your safety, so please buckle up! Remember to stay alert and focused while driving. Itâ€™s crucial for your safety and everyone else on the road. Keep up the safe driving!
